1. Encapsulation is wrapping of data and member functions in a 
   single unit called class.

2.Making class and defining member functions and data members is Encapsulaton.

3.Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data and the functions that operate 
on that data into a single unit, typically a class. In C++, this is done by using
 access specifiers like private, protected, and public. The main goal is to protect
  the internal state of an object from outside interference and misuse.
For example, we usually keep data members private, and provide public getter 
and setter methods to access or modify them in a controlled way. This allows us 
to add validation or security logic, and makes the code more maintainable and secure.
