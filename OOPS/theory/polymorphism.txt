    Poly = multiple
    morph = forms 

1. Polymorpism is the ability of object to take on different forms or behave in different   
   ways on the context in which they are used.

   eg:  Constructor overloading: object automatically choose and calls the  
                                 onstructor on the basis of parameters passed.
                            
        Function overloading: Creating function of same name in a class but with and 
                              without parameters to work differently when we pass a 
                              parameter and when we don't. 
        Operator overloading: this is also present  
                              

2. Types of Polymorpism:
            ~ Compile time Polymorpism
                    eg: Constructor overloading
                        Function overloading
            ~ Run time Polymorpism
                    eg: Function overriding: Parent and child class both contain same 
                                             function but the implementation is different.
                                             Then parent class is said to be overridden.   

3.difference in overloading and overriding:
        ~ In overloading we create function with same name in the same class.

        ~ In overriding, child class also has a function with same name as the parent   
          but the implementation is different.
