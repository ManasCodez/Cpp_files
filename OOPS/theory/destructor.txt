1. Destructor is opposite of constructor.
    like contructor is used for allocating memory, Destructor is used for deallacating 
    memory.

2. If we have allocated memory dynamically, we have to remove it dynamically.
        eg:
        class deepstudent{ 
            public:
            string name;
            double* cgpaptr;

            deepstudent(string name, double cgpa){   //constructor
            this->name=name;
            cgpaptr = new double; //adding new double to allocate new memory
            *cgpaptr = cgpa;//changes value of the new memory address to the required one. 
            }

            ~deepstudent(){
                cout << "Hi i am Destructor";
            }
        }
