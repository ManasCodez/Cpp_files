1. Destructor is opposite of constructor.
    like contructor is used for allocating memory, Destructor is used for deallacating 
    memory.

2. If we don't make a Destructor, it is created by itself, just like the constructor.

3. If we have allocated memory dynamically, we have to remove it dynamically.
    ~ DESTRUCTOR ONLY DELETES THE STATIC MEMORY !! 
        
        eg:
        class deepstudent{ 
            public:
            string name;
            double* cgpaptr;

            deepstudent(string name, double cgpa){   //constructor
            this->name=name;
            cgpaptr = new double; //adding new double to allocate new memory
            *cgpaptr = cgpa;//changes value of the new memory address to the required one. 
            }

            ~deepstudent(){
                cout << "Hi i am Destructor";
            }
        }
