1.  When we have created a object like t1 and has passed the values for it ,
    then for created another object with same values we can use the copy constructor.
    
    //C++ has a default copy constructor so we can use it directly
    eg:
        int main(){
            teacher t1("manas", "CS","computer",100000);
            teacher t2(t1); //copy constructor 
        }
        //now values of t1 and t2 are same

2. Custom copy constructor:
        when we are using, teacher t2(t1), above c++ is using the default copy constructor.
        we can man our own custom copy constructor

        eg:
        teacher(teacher& obj){
            cout << "i am custom copy constructor";
            this->name = obj.name;
            this->dept= obj.dept;
            this->subject= obj.subject;
        }
