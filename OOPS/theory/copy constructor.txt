1. When we have created a object like t1 and has passed the values for it ,
   then for created another object with same values we can use the copy constructor.
    //C++ has a default copy constructor so we can use it directly
   eg:
        int main(){
            teacher t1("manas", "CS","computer",100000);
            teacher t2(t1); //copy constructor 
        }
        //now values of t1 and t2 are same
