1. Hiding all unnescessary details & showing only the important part is called abstration.

2. Access modifier can be used to implement abstraction.

3.Using abstract classes:
        ~ abstract classes are used to provide a base class from which other classes
          can be derived.

        ~ They cannot be instantiated and are meant to be inherited.
        
        ~ Abstract classes are typically used to define an interface for derived classes.

        ~ It is made only for inheritance, not used to make objects.


4. Static keyword:
          Static variables: variables declared static in a function are created and initialised 
                            once for the lifetime of the program. //in function

                            Static variables in a class are created and initialised once. They
                            are shared by all the objects of the class. //in class
