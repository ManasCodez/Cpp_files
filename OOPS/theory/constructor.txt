1. It is a special method which invokes automatically when creating a object. 
   Used for initialisation.

   Properties:
        ~ Same name as class
        ~ doesn't have a return type
        ~ only called once (during the initialisation of a object)
        ~ memory allocation happens when it is called(opject creation).


2. We can make the constructor even before initializing the Data Members 
   (or Member Variables) of the class.
      example:
      
         class teacher{
            public: 
            teacher(){ //constructor
               name = "NULL";
               dept = "CS";
               subject = "Computer";
            } 
            string name; //date members
            string dept;
            string subject;
         }

3. There are two types of constructor:
      ~ parameterized
      ~ non - parameterized

      eg:   teacher(){ //non parameterized
               name = "NULL";
               dept = "CS";
               subject = "Computer";
            }

            teacher(string n, string d, string s, int sal){ //parameterized
            name = n, dept = d, subject = s, salary = sal;
            }


4. This pointer: //can only be used in a member function not a normal function
         "this" is a special pointer in C++ that points to the current object.
   ~ it is used when the name of the passed argument is same as the Variable in the constructor.

   eg:
      teacher(string name, string dept, string subject, int salary){
            this->name = name;
            this->dept = dept;
            this->subject = subject;
            this->salary = salary;
        }
