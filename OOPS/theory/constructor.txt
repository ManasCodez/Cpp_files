1. It is a special method which invokes automatically when creating a object. 
   Used for initialisation.

   Properties:
        ~ Same name as class
        ~ doesn't have a return type
        ~ only called once (during the initialisation of a object)
        ~ memory allocation happens when it is called.


2. We can make the constructor even before initializing the Data Members 
   (or Member Variables) of the class.
      example:
      
         class teacher{
            public: 
            teacher(){ //constructor
               name = "NULL";
               dept = "CS";
               subject = "Computer";
            } 
            string name; //date members
            string dept;
            string subject;
         }
