1. When Properties & members functions of base class are passed on to the derived class.
        ~ we can use the Properties of a class in another class.
        
2. Types of inheritance:
        ~ Single inheritance: We pass on the the Properties from one class to another.

        ~ Multi level inheritance: first we pass the Properties of one class to other,
          than other the second class to the third class.

        ~ Multi inheritance: We pass Properties from multiple classes to a single class.


        ~ Hierarchial inheritance: Passing Properties from a single class to multiple      classes.

        ~ Hybrid inheritance: Mixture of every inheritance.
