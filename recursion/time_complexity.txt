time complexity for recusion 
formula :  f(n) = k + f(n-1)
           f(n-1) = k + f(n-2)
           f(n-2) = k + f(n-3)   
           .
           .
           .
           .
           f(1) = k + f(0)

           adding all the right and left side we get 

           f(n) = nk + f(0)
           f(0) is contant and k is also constant

           so final time complexity after ignoring constant is : 
           O(n)
